# VPN DNS Issue - Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Issue:** DNS stops working when VPN activated
**Status:** üîç **ANALYZED**

---

## Problem Summary

When activating the WireGuard VPN (`wg-quick up wg0`):
- ‚úÖ SSH still works (split-tunnel working correctly)
- ‚ùå DNS resolution stops working
- ‚ùå HTTPS requests hang/timeout
- ‚ö†Ô∏è VPN interface crashes or shuts down

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. VPN Config Has DNS Servers

**VPN Config (`peer48-binance-only.conf`):**
```
DNS = 161.97.189.51,161.97.189.52
```

**What happens during VPN activation:**
```bash
[#] resolvconf -a wg0 -m 0 -x
```

This command tries to modify system DNS resolution to use VPN's DNS servers.

### 2. DNS Configuration Conflict

**System uses:** systemd-resolved (127.0.0.53)
**VPN tries to set:** 161.97.189.51, 161.97.189.52

**Conflict:**
- systemd-resolved is managing DNS
- resolvconf tries to override it
- Systems fight each other
- DNS resolution breaks

### 3. VPN DNS Servers Unreachable

**VPN DNS servers:** 161.97.189.51, 161.97.189.52

**Problem:**
- These might only be accessible THROUGH the VPN tunnel
- But split-tunnel only routes Binance IPs (76.223.0.0/16, 54.76.0.0/16, 99.81.0.0/16)
- DNS server IPs (161.97.189.0/24) NOT in AllowedIPs
- **DNS servers unreachable** ‚Üí All DNS fails

### 4. VPN Crashes After Activation

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Right after activation:
sudo wg show  # Shows VPN running

# Shortly after:
ip link show wg0  # Device "wg0" does not exist
```

**Why it crashes:**
- DNS resolution fails
- VPN can't reach its own DNS servers
- VPN keepalive or peer communication fails
- WireGuard shuts down the interface

## Technical Details

### Routing Analysis

**AllowedIPs in VPN config:**
```
76.223.0.0/16   # Binance range 1
54.76.0.0/16    # Binance range 2
99.81.0.0/16    # Binance range 3
```

**VPN DNS servers:**
```
161.97.189.51   # NOT in AllowedIPs
161.97.189.52   # NOT in AllowedIPs
```

**Result:**
- Packets to Binance IPs ‚Üí VPN tunnel ‚úÖ
- Packets to DNS servers ‚Üí Normal route ‚ùå (but DNS servers expect VPN tunnel)
- **DNS servers unreachable** = DNS failure

### systemd-resolved Behavior

**Current config:**
```
/etc/resolv.conf ‚Üí symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
nameserver 127.0.0.53  # systemd-resolved local stub
```

**When resolvconf runs:**
- Tries to add wg0 DNS servers to systemd-resolved
- But DNS servers unreachable
- systemd-resolved marks them as failed
- Might affect overall DNS resolution

## Why DNS Appears to Work Now

**Current test results:**
- ‚úÖ `nslookup google.com` - Works
- ‚úÖ `nslookup fapi.binance.com` - Works
- ‚úÖ `ping 8.8.8.8` - Works
- ‚ùå `curl https://fapi.binance.com` - Hangs/timeout

**Reason:**
- VPN crashed and wg0 interface removed
- System reverted to normal DNS (209.126.70.51, 209.126.70.52)
- DNS working again because VPN is down
- But Binance API still geo-blocked (no VPN active)

---

## The Circular Problem

**Catch-22 situation:**

1. **Need VPN for Binance access** ‚Üí But VPN has DNS servers
2. **VPN sets DNS servers** ‚Üí But DNS servers not in AllowedIPs
3. **DNS servers unreachable** ‚Üí VPN can't communicate
4. **VPN crashes** ‚Üí Back to no Binance access

---

## Why Market-Data Works Without VPN

**From code analysis (`websocket.rs:112-113`):**
```rust
// Skip REST snapshot fetch (geo-blocked) - build orderbook from WebSocket
info!("Building orderbook for {} from WebSocket updates (REST API geo-blocked)");
```

**Binance WebSocket for Public Data:**
- ‚ùå REST API: Geo-blocked (HTTP 451)
- ‚úÖ **WebSocket: NOT geo-blocked** (works without VPN!)

**Why it's different:**
- Public market data WebSocket: `wss://fstream.binance.com/stream` ‚Üí NOT geo-restricted
- Private authenticated endpoints: REST API + User Data Stream ‚Üí GEO-RESTRICTED

---

## Why Account-Monitor Needs VPN

**Account-monitor tries to access:**
1. **Binance Futures REST API** - Account balance, positions
   - Endpoint: `https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v2/account`
   - Status: **GEO-BLOCKED** ‚ùå

2. **Binance User Data Stream WebSocket** - Real-time account updates
   - Endpoint: `wss://fstream.binance.com/ws/{listenKey}`
   - Status: **GEO-BLOCKED** ‚ùå

Both require authentication + both are geo-restricted.

## Solutions (Not Implemented Yet)

### Option 1: Fix VPN DNS Issue ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Problem:** DNS servers not routable through split-tunnel

**Fix:** Remove DNS from VPN config or add DNS IPs to AllowedIPs
```
# Remove this line:
DNS = 161.97.189.51,161.97.189.52

# Or add DNS servers to AllowedIPs:
AllowedIPs = 76.223.0.0/16, 54.76.0.0/16, 99.81.0.0/16, 161.97.189.0/24
```

**Result:**
- VPN stays up
- Uses system DNS (not VPN DNS)
- SSH stays alive
- Binance accessible

### Option 2: Use Binance Testnet ‚≠ê EASIER

**No geo-restrictions on testnet:**
- `https://testnet.binancefuture.com` - Works from anywhere
- No VPN needed
- Free test funds
- Perfect for development

**Update account-monitor config:**
```yaml
exchange:
  rest_url: "https://testnet.binancefuture.com"
  ws_url: "wss://stream.binancefuture.com/ws"
```

### Option 3: Full-Tunnel VPN with Systemd Integration

**Use systemd to manage VPN:**
- Proper dependency management
- Auto-restart on failure
- Better DNS integration
- But loses split-tunnel benefit (might need work on DNS)

## Current State Summary

**VPN Status:** ‚ùå Down (crashed after brief activation)
**SSH:** ‚úÖ Working (split-tunnel protected it)
**DNS:** ‚úÖ Working now (VPN down, reverted to normal)
**Binance Access:** ‚ùå Geo-blocked (no active VPN)
**Market-Data:** ‚úÖ Working (WebSocket not geo-blocked)
**Account-Monitor:** ‚ùå Failing (needs authenticated endpoints)

## Answers to Your Question

**Q: When running VPN, SSH still works but DNS stops working - why?**

**A: The VPN config has DNS servers (161.97.189.51/52) that:**
1. Are NOT included in the split-tunnel AllowedIPs routes
2. Can't be reached through normal routing (expect VPN tunnel)
3. Can't be reached through VPN tunnel (not in AllowedIPs)
4. Become unreachable ‚Üí DNS fails
5. VPN crashes due to unreachable DNS
6. System DNS confused/broken until VPN fully removed

**The fix:** Either remove DNS line from VPN config, or use system DNS instead of VPN DNS.

**VPN Infrastructure:** ‚úÖ Exists and partially working
**DNS Issue:** üî¥ Critical blocker preventing VPN stability
**Recommendation:** Remove `DNS = ...` line from VPN config to fix
