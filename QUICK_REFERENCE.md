```

## How to Deploy

### 1. Rebuild All Services
```bash
cd /home/mm/dev/b25
./rebuild-services.sh
```

### 2. Restart Services
Stop and start all 8 services using your service manager (systemd, docker-compose, etc.)

### 3. Test CORS Headers
```bash
./test-cors-headers.sh
```

### 4. Verify in Browser
- Open dashboard UI
- Check browser console (F12)
- Should see NO CORS errors

## Quick Test
```bash
# Test one service
curl -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" http://localhost:8086/health -v

# Look for these headers in response:
# Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
# Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, OPTIONS
# Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

## Service Ports
- 8080: API Gateway
- 8081: Order Execution
- 8082: Strategy Engine
- 8083: Account Monitor
- 8084: Configuration
- 8085: Risk Manager
- 8086: Dashboard Server
- 8087: Market Data

## Rollback
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- services/*/internal/health/*.go
git checkout HEAD -- services/*/cmd/server/main.go
git checkout HEAD -- services/*/src/health.rs
# Then rebuild and restart
```
