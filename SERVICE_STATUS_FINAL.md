## ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL SERVICE (1/9)

### 9. Account Monitor (8084) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Status: Started but has errors
- Config: Fixed and loads ‚úÖ
- gRPC: Running on port 50053 ‚úÖ
- HTTP: Port conflict (metrics)
- **Binance Geo-Restriction:** STILL BLOCKED

**Error:** "Service unavailable from a restricted location"

**Why VPN didn't fix it:**
- Services run as separate processes
- They don't inherit VPN routing automatically
- Need to force traffic through VPN interface

---

## üîß VPN ISSUE

**Problem:** Your VPN config routes ALL traffic (0.0.0.0/0) which kills SSH.

**Current state:** VPN is down to keep SSH alive.

**Options:**
1. **Accept geo-restriction** - Most features work without account API
2. **Use different VPS location** - Not restricted by Binance
3. **Split tunnel VPN** - Complex setup to route only Binance through VPN

- ‚úÖ Strategy analysis (3 algorithms)
- ‚úÖ Order validation
- ‚úÖ Order execution (simulation mode)

You can:
1. **Trade now** in simulation mode (safe)
2. **View market data** in real-time
