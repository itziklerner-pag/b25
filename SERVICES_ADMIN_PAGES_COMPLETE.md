5. **Configuration Service** - Port 8085 - NOT RUNNING
6. **Order Execution** - Port 8081 - NOT RUNNING
7. **Risk Manager** - Port 9095 - NOT RUNNING
8. **Strategy Engine** - Port 8082 - NOT RUNNING

---

## üîç Why API Gateway Shows "DEGRADED" - EXPLAINED

### This is **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**, not a bug!

**Reason**: The API Gateway implements **aggregated health checking** that monitors all downstream services. When ANY downstream service is unhealthy, it reports "degraded" status.

**Current Situation**:
- 3 services are healthy (account_monitor, dashboard_server, market_data)
- 4 services are down (configuration, order_execution, risk_manager, strategy_engine)
- Therefore: API Gateway correctly reports **status: "degraded"**

**File Location**: `/home/mm/dev/b25/services/api-gateway/internal/handlers/health.go` (lines 59-71)

**Logic**:
```go
if h.config.Health.CheckServices {
    services := h.checkServices()
    response["services"] = services

    allHealthy := true
    for _, status := range services {
        if statusMap["status"] != "healthy" {
            allHealthy = false
            break
        }
    }

    if !allHealthy {
        response["status"] = "degraded"  // ‚Üê This is correct!
    }
}
```

**To Make it "Healthy"**: Start the 4 missing services (configuration, order-execution, risk-manager, strategy-engine)

**This Design is Intentional Because**:
- API Gateway is the system entry point
- It needs to report overall system health for monitoring/load balancers
- "degraded" tells operators that some functionality is unavailable
- This is better than hiding service failures

**Admin Page**: Shows which specific services are down

### Dashboard Server: "ok" ‚úÖ CORRECT
**Why**: The service itself is running fine
**Expected**: YES - it only checks its own health, not downstream
**Action Needed**: None - working as designed
**Admin Page**: Shows real-time metrics and connections

### Account Monitor: "healthy" ‚úÖ CORRECT
**Why**: All dependencies are operational (database, redis, websocket)
**Expected**: YES - database connected, redis connected, Binance Futures WebSocket connected

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional)

To make the API Gateway show "healthy" instead of "degraded":

1. **Start Configuration Service** (port 8085)
2. **Start Order Execution Service** (port 8081)
3. **Start Risk Manager** (port 9095)
4. **Start Strategy Engine** (port 8082)

Once all 7 services are running, the API Gateway will automatically change status from "degraded" to "healthy".
