# Nginx Service Routing Fix - 2025-10-06

## Summary
Fixed nginx proxy configuration for B25 trading system services by correcting port mismatches and verifying service routing.

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. Order Execution Service
- **Problem**: Nginx was proxying to `localhost:8081` but service runs on `localhost:9091`
- **Fix**: Updated `/services/order-execution/` proxy_pass to `http://localhost:9091/`
- **Status**: FIXED and VERIFIED

### 2. Strategy Engine Service
- **Problem**: Nginx was proxying to `localhost:8082` but service runs on `localhost:9092`
- **Fix**: Updated `/services/strategy-engine/` proxy_pass to `http://localhost:9092/`
- **Status**: FIXED and VERIFIED

### 3. Account Monitor Service
- **Problem**: Nginx was proxying to `localhost:8084` but service runs on `localhost:9093`
- **Fix**: Updated `/services/account-monitor/` proxy_pass to `http://localhost:9093/`
- **Status**: FIXED (but service not currently running on port 9093)

### 4. Prometheus Service
- **Problem**: Initially reported as missing, but already configured correctly
- **Current Config**: `/services/prometheus/` proxies to `http://localhost:9090/`
- **Status**: NO CHANGE NEEDED - Already correct and verified working

## Changes Made

### File: /etc/nginx/sites-available/mm.itziklerner.com

**Line 149**: order-execution proxy port
```diff
- proxy_pass http://localhost:8081/;
+ proxy_pass http://localhost:9091/;
```

**Line 169**: strategy-engine proxy port
```diff
- proxy_pass http://localhost:8082/;
+ proxy_pass http://localhost:9092/;
```

**Line 209**: account-monitor proxy port
```diff
- proxy_pass http://localhost:8084/;
+ proxy_pass http://localhost:9093/;
```

## Verification Results

### Nginx Configuration Test
```bash
$ sudo nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

### Nginx Reload
```bash
$ sudo systemctl reload nginx
# Completed successfully with no errors
```

### Service Health Check Results

#### Direct Backend Tests (bypassing nginx):
```
order-execution (9091): HTTP 200 ✓
  Response: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-10-06T21:58:36.102128886+02:00",...}

strategy-engine (9092): HTTP 200 ✓
  Response: {"status":"healthy","service":"strategy-engine"}

account-monitor (9093): Connection Failed ✗
  Note: Service is not currently running on this port

prometheus (9090): HTTP 200 ✓
  Response: Prometheus Server is Healthy.
```

#### Port Listening Status:
```
Port 9090: Prometheus - LISTENING ✓
Port 9091: order-execution - LISTENING ✓
Port 9092: strategy-engine - LISTENING ✓
Port 9093: account-monitor - NOT LISTENING ✗
```

## Current Service Port Mapping

| Service | Nginx Route | Backend Port | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| market-data | /services/market-data/ | 8080 | No change |
| order-execution | /services/order-execution/ | 9091 | **FIXED** |
| strategy-engine | /services/strategy-engine/ | 9092 | **FIXED** |
| risk-manager | /services/risk-manager/ | 8083 | No change |
| account-monitor | /services/account-monitor/ | 9093 | **FIXED** (service down) |
| configuration | /services/configuration/ | 8085 | No change |
| dashboard-server | /services/dashboard-server/ | 8086 | No change |
| api-gateway | /services/api-gateway/ | 8000 | No change |
| auth-service | /services/auth-service/ | 9097 | No change |
| prometheus | /services/prometheus/ | 9090 | Already correct |
| grafana-internal | /services/grafana-internal/ | 3001 | No change |

## Additional Notes

1. **account-monitor service** needs to be started on port 9093 for the nginx routing to work
2. All nginx configuration changes have been applied and nginx has been reloaded
3. No nginx errors were encountered during configuration test or reload
4. Prometheus proxy configuration was already correct and did not need changes

## Next Steps

To complete the service routing setup:
1. Start the account-monitor service on port 9093
2. Verify account-monitor health endpoint responds correctly
3. Test all service routes through nginx proxy on domain (https://mm.itziklerner.com/services/...)
