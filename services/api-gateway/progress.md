## Service Routes Summary

### Public Routes (No Auth)
- `GET /health` - Health check with service status
- `GET /health/liveness` - Kubernetes liveness probe
- `GET /health/readiness` - Kubernetes readiness probe
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics
- `GET /version` - Version information

### Protected Routes (Auth Required)
- **Market Data**: 4 endpoints (symbols, orderbook, trades, ticker)
- **Orders**: 6 endpoints (create, read, cancel, active, history)
- **Strategies**: 8 endpoints (CRUD, start, stop, status)
- **Account**: 5 endpoints (balance, positions, P&L, trades)
- **Risk**: 4 endpoints (limits, status, emergency stop)
- **Config**: 4 endpoints (CRUD operations)
- **Dashboard**: 2 endpoints (status, summary)

## Metrics Collected
1. HTTP request count (by method, path, status)
2. HTTP request duration (histogram with percentiles)
3. HTTP request/response sizes
4. Active connections
5. Circuit breaker states (per service)
6. Cache hits/misses (per endpoint)
7. Rate limit exceeded counts (by type)
8. Upstream request count (by service, method, status)
9. Upstream latency (histogram per service)
10. Upstream errors (by service and error type)
11. Authentication attempts (by type)
12. Authentication failures (by type and reason)

3. **Gobreaker**: Battle-tested circuit breaker
4. **Zap Logger**: Fast structured logging
5. **Prometheus**: Standard metrics format
6. **YAML Config**: Human-readable, environment variable support

## Performance Characteristics

### Target Performance
- Latency (p50): <5ms (gateway overhead)
- Latency (p99): <20ms (gateway overhead)
- Throughput: 50,000+ req/s (single instance)
- Memory: ~50MB baseline
- CPU: <20% under normal load

### Scalability
- Horizontally scalable (stateless)
- Redis for shared cache (if multiple instances)
- No single point of failure

## Deployment Ready

### Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Grafana dashboard compatible
- Structured JSON logs
- Alert-ready metrics

## Next Steps (Post-Deployment)

1. **Integration Testing**: Test with actual backend services
2. **Load Testing**: Verify performance targets
3. **Security Audit**: Review auth and RBAC implementation
4. **Grafana Dashboards**: Create visualization dashboards
5. **Alert Rules**: Define Prometheus alert rules
6. **Documentation**: Add Swagger/OpenAPI spec
7. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate build and deployment

## Notes

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Update JWT secret in production config
- [ ] Update API keys in production config
- [ ] Configure Redis connection
- [ ] Set appropriate rate limits
- [ ] Configure CORS origins
- [ ] Enable TLS/SSL
- [ ] Set up log aggregation
- [ ] Configure Prometheus scraping
- [ ] Set resource limits in Kubernetes
- [ ] Test all health check endpoints
- [ ] Verify circuit breaker thresholds
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Load test the gateway

### Security Notes
- JWT secret must be strong (256+ bits)
- API keys should be rotated regularly
- TLS/SSL recommended for production
- Rate limits prevent abuse
- CORS protects against unauthorized origins

### Monitoring Notes
- Monitor circuit breaker states
- Alert on high error rates
- Track cache hit ratios
- Monitor upstream latency
- Alert on rate limit violations
