# B25 System - Current Status & Next Steps

## What Works:
- ✅ Domain: https://mm.itziklerner.com
- ✅ SSL certificate active
- ✅ All 11 services running
- ✅ Binance live data flowing
- ✅ Dashboard Server broadcasting (sequence #10,000+)
- ✅ WebSocket connected
- ✅ Initial snapshot loads (Update Count: 4)

## The One Remaining Issue:
**Incremental updates not working** - prices don't update after initial load

### Root Cause:
Dashboard Server's `computeDiff()` creates flat diff:
```go
diff["market_data.BTCUSDT.last_price"] = 123456
```

But client expects nested structure:
```javascript
{market_data: {BTCUSDT: {last_price: 123456}}}
```

### Solution Options:

**Option A: Send Full Snapshot (Current - Simple)**
- Every broadcast sends complete state
- ~10KB per message
- Works immediately
- Bandwidth: ~40KB/s per client

**Option B: Fix Differential Updates (Optimal)**
- Restructure diff to nested objects
- ~1-2KB per message when only prices change
- Better bandwidth usage
- Bandwidth: ~4-8KB/s per client
- Takes 30min to implement properly

**Recommendation:** Your system is 99% done. Since you want the best system with no compromises, let me spend 30 more minutes to implement proper differential updates.

This will give you:
- ✅ Live updating prices
- ✅ Minimal bandwidth (better for scalability)
- ✅ Professional HFT system architecture
- ✅ No compromises

Proceed with Option B?
