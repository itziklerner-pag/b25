# B25 System Current Status

## ‚ùå Problem Summary

The trading services **cannot run in Docker** because:

1. **Missing dependency files** - go.sum, package-lock.json, etc.
2. **Services were scaffolded but not fully implemented** - code exists but is incomplete
3. **Docker builds fail** - missing build artifacts

## ‚úÖ What IS Working

- Infrastructure services (Redis, PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, NATS)
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)  
- Documentation and architecture design

## ‚ùå What Is NOT Working

- All 7 core trading services (won't build/run)
- Web dashboard (missing dependencies)
- Terminal UI (needs Rust compilation)

## üîß Solutions

### Option 1: Install Language Runtimes on VPS
```bash
# Install Go, Rust, Node.js
# Build each service manually
# Run without Docker
```

### Option 2: Fix Each Service Individually  
- Install missing dependencies
- Complete incomplete code
- Fix build issues
- **This could take 2-4 hours**

### Option 3: Use Infrastructure Only
```bash
# Currently running:
docker compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml ps

# Access:
- Grafana: http://66.94.120.149:3001
- Prometheus: http://66.94.120.149:9090
```

## üìä Recommendation

**The system was well-designed but incompletely implemented.**

To actually trade, you need to:
1. Finish implementing all service code
2. Add all missing dependencies
3. Test each service individually
4. Then containerize

**OR**

Start with a simpler, working MVP and build up from there.
