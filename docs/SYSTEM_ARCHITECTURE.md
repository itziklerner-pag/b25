- High-frequency trading with sub-second decision cycles
- Maker-taker fee optimization (prioritizing maker orders)

### Key Capabilities

- **Market Data Ingestion:** Real-time order book and trade stream processing
- **Strategy Execution:** Plugin-based trading strategy framework
- **Order Management:** Full lifecycle management with validation and reconciliation
- **Risk Management:** Multi-layer position and drawdown controls
- **Account Monitoring:** Balance tracking and P&L calculation

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Latency Minimization

**Target:** Sub-millisecond internal processing (<1ms from signal to order)

- **Zero-copy data structures** where possible
- **Lock-free concurrent algorithms** for hot paths
- **Cache-aligned memory layouts** for CPU efficiency
- **Minimal allocations** in critical execution paths
- **Asynchronous I/O** with non-blocking operations

### 2. Process Isolation

**Pattern:** Microservices with independent failure domains

- Each major component runs as a separate OS process
- Process crashes are isolated and do not cascade
- Independent restart and upgrade capabilities
- Clear service boundaries with well-defined interfaces

### 3. Fault Tolerance

**Approach:** Design for failure at every level

- **Circuit breakers** for external dependencies
- **Automatic reconnection** with exponential backoff
- **Health monitoring** with alerting
- **Graceful degradation** when subsystems fail
- **State reconciliation** mechanisms

### 4. Observable Systems

**Philosophy:** Instrument everything

- **Structured logging** with correlation IDs
- **Metrics collection** for all operations
- **Distributed tracing** for request flows
- **Health check endpoints** for all services
- **Real-time dashboards** for operators

### 5. Configuration Over Code

**Strategy:** Externalize all behavior parameters

- **Environment variables** for runtime configuration
- **Configuration files** for complex settings
- **Hot-reload** capabilities where appropriate
- **Strategy parameters** externalized from logic
- **Risk limits** adjustable without redeployment

## Fault Tolerance

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Mechanism:** Prevent cascading failures

**States:**
- **Closed:** Normal operation, requests pass through
- **Open:** Too many failures, reject all requests
- **Half-Open:** Test recovery with limited requests

**Configuration:**
- Failure threshold (e.g., 5 failures in 30 seconds)
- Timeout duration (e.g., 30 seconds in Open state)
- Half-open test count (e.g., 3 requests)

**Applied To:**
- Exchange REST API calls
- WebSocket connections
- Database queries
- Downstream service calls

**Actions on Open:**
- Log critical error
- Emit alert
- For trading: Halt all trading, enter observation mode
- For data: Use cached data, widen uncertainty bounds

### Automatic Reconnection

**Exponential Backoff Strategy:**
```
attempt = 0
base_delay = 1 second
max_delay = 60 seconds

while not connected:
  delay = min(base_delay * (2 ^ attempt), max_delay)
  wait(delay + random_jitter(0, delay * 0.1))
  attempt_connection()
  attempt += 1
```

**Applied To:**
- WebSocket connections to exchange
- Database connections
- Message queue connections
- Downstream service connections

**Reconnection Actions:**
- Re-authenticate if needed
- Resubscribe to data streams
- Full state synchronization
- Resume normal operations

### Health Monitoring

**Health Check Types:**

1. **Liveness:** Is the process alive?
   - HTTP endpoint returning 200 OK
   - Respond within timeout (e.g., 1 second)

2. **Readiness:** Is the service ready to serve?
   - All dependencies connected
   - Critical data loaded
   - No circuit breakers open

3. **Startup:** Has initialization completed?
   - Configuration loaded
   - Database connections established
   - Initial data fetched

**Monitoring Intervals:**
- Liveness: 10 seconds
- Readiness: 10 seconds
- Startup: 5 seconds

**Failure Actions:**
- Liveness failure: Restart process
- Readiness failure: Remove from load balancer
- Startup failure: Retry with backoff, alert after N failures

### Graceful Degradation

**Scenarios and Responses:**

| Scenario | Degraded Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Market data unavailable | Use last known snapshot, widen spreads, reduce position sizes |
| Order execution failing | Cancel pending orders, enter observation mode, alert operator |
| High latency detected (>100ms internal) | Reduce order frequency, switch to less aggressive strategies |
| Position reconciliation mismatch | Use exchange as source of truth, alert, halt if repeated |
| Database unavailable | Use cached data (hot cache), disable new strategy loading |

### Emergency Stop

**Triggers:**
- Daily drawdown exceeds maximum
- Margin ratio below critical threshold
- Repeated order rejections (e.g., >10 in 1 minute)
- Manual trigger via dashboard
- Critical service health check failures

**Actions:**
1. Stop accepting new signals from strategies
2. Cancel all open orders
3. (Optional) Close all positions with market orders
4. Persist current state to disk
5. Alert operators via all channels
6. Enter observation mode (read-only)

## Security Model

### Authentication

- IP whitelisting enabled on exchange

**Inter-Service Authentication:**

### Authorization

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- **Admin:** Full system control, config changes

**At Rest:**
- Database encryption
- Encrypted backups
- Secrets encrypted with key management service

**Sensitive Data:**
- API keys and secrets never logged
- Masking in logs (show first 4 chars only)

### Rate Limiting

**Exchange Rate Limits:**
- Respect exchange limits (e.g., 1200 req/min for Binance)
- Client-side rate limiter with buffer (e.g., 1000 req/min)
- Distribute requests evenly over time window

**Internal Rate Limits:**
- Dashboard API: 100 req/sec per client
- WebSocket connections: 100 concurrent max
- Alert notifications: 10 per minute per alert type

### Audit Logging

**Tick:** Minimum price movement for a trading pair

**Time-In-Force (TIF):** How long an order remains active

**WebSocket:** Protocol for real-time bidirectional communication

## Appendix: Technology-Specific Recommendations

This section provides guidance on technology selection based on common use cases. These are suggestions, not requirements.

### For Ultra-Low Latency (Data Plane)

**Languages:** C++, Rust, C, Go
**Rationale:** Minimal runtime overhead, manual memory management, zero-cost abstractions

### For Rapid Development (Control Plane)

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go
**Rationale:** Fast iteration, rich libraries, hot-reload capabilities

### For Hot Cache

**Options:** Redis, Memcached, Hazelcast
**Rationale:** In-memory speed, pub/sub support, mature tooling

### For Time-Series Database

**Options:** TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension), InfluxDB, Prometheus
**Rationale:** Optimized for time-range queries, compression, retention policies

### For Configuration Database

**Options:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite (single-server)
**Rationale:** ACID properties, relational integrity, familiar SQL

### For Message Queues

**Options:** ZeroMQ (low-latency), RabbitMQ, NATS, Kafka (persistent)
**Rationale:** Performance characteristics match use case

### For RPC

**Options:** gRPC (language-agnostic), Cap'n Proto (zero-copy)
**Rationale:** Efficient serialization, schema evolution support

### For WebSocket Server

**Options:** Language-native libraries (mature ecosystems)
**Rationale:** Avoid additional dependencies, proven stability

### For Containerization

**Options:** Docker + Docker Compose (simple), Kubernetes (scalable)
**Rationale:** Balance between complexity and capabilities
