## Communication Architecture

### Inter-Service Communication

**Synchronous (Request-Reply):**
- gRPC for typed, efficient RPC
- REST/HTTP for simpler integrations

**Asynchronous (Pub/Sub):**
- Redis Pub/Sub (simple, in-memory)
- NATS (lightweight, cloud-native)
- RabbitMQ (feature-rich, persistent)
- Kafka (high-throughput, persistent)

**Shared Memory:**
- Only within single-host deployments
- Market data pipeline â†’ Strategy engine (same machine)

### Data Flow Summary

```

## Deployment Recommendations

### Container Per Service

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml example structure
services:
  market-data:
    build: ./market-data
    networks: [trading-net]
    ports: [9090:9090]  # metrics

  order-execution:
    build: ./order-execution
    networks: [trading-net]
    ports: [9091:9091]

  strategy-engine:
    build: ./strategy-engine
    networks: [trading-net]
    ports: [9092:9092]

  # ... etc
```

### Technology Stack Independence

Each service directory contains:
```
service-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/               # Source code in any language
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/             # Test suite
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile         # Container definition
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # Service documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ config.example     # Configuration template
â””â”€â”€ ui/                # Observability UI (if applicable)
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Independent Development

1. **Service Owner:** Each service can have dedicated developer(s)
2. **Technology Choice:** Team picks best tool for the job
3. **Contract-First:** Define APIs/interfaces before implementation
4. **Mock Dependencies:** Use mocks for other services during development

### Integration Testing

1. **Contract Testing:** Verify API contracts
2. **Docker Compose:** Test all services together locally
3. **Staging Environment:** Full integration testing
4. **Canary Deployments:** Gradual rollout to production

---

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Strategy Engine:** Multiple instances behind load balancer
- **Dashboard Server:** Multiple instances for HA
- **Order Execution:** Single instance (or active-passive HA)

### Vertical Scaling

- **Market Data Service:** Dedicated high-performance server
- **Metrics Service:** Larger storage capacity

---

## Monitoring Requirements

Each service must expose:

1. **Health Check:** `/health` endpoint (liveness, readiness, startup)
2. **Metrics:** `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus format)
3. **Logging:** Structured JSON logs to stdout/stderr
4. **Tracing:** Correlation IDs in all inter-service calls
