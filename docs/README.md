### For LLM-Assisted Development

When working with AI coding assistants:

**Prompt Template:**
```
I'm building a high-frequency trading system. I've read the architectural
documentation. Now I need to implement [COMPONENT NAME].

Please review the specifications in COMPONENT_SPECIFICATIONS.md for
[COMPONENT NAME] and generate production-ready code in [LANGUAGE] that:
1. Implements all functional requirements (FR-XX-XXX)
2. Meets non-functional requirements (NFR-XX-XXX)
3. Uses the specified data structures
4. Includes error handling as documented
5. Exports the specified metrics

Use these technology choices:
- Language: [YOUR CHOICE]
- Database: [YOUR CHOICE]
- Communication: [YOUR CHOICE]
```

**Specific Examples:**

For Market Data Pipeline:
```
I need to implement the Market Data Pipeline in Rust.

Reference: COMPONENT_SPECIFICATIONS.md - Market Data Pipeline section
- Implement FR-MD-001 through FR-MD-005
- Target: <100Î¼s latency (NFR-MD-001)
- Use tokio-tungstenite for WebSocket
- Publish to Redis pub/sub

Generate complete implementation with all error handling.
```

For Strategy Engine:
```
I need to implement the Strategy Engine in Python for rapid development.

Reference: COMPONENT_SPECIFICATIONS.md - Strategy Engine section
- Implement plugin system (FR-SE-001)
- Support hot-reload
- Include example momentum strategy
- Connect to ZeroMQ market data feed

Generate complete implementation with type hints.
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Four Layers?

1. **Persistence Layer:** Separate concerns of data durability from business logic
2. **Data Plane:** Ultra-low latency requires isolation from control logic
3. **Control Plane:** Business logic and strategies need flexibility
4. **Observability Layer:** Must not impact data plane performance

### Why Process Isolation?

- Fault containment: One component crash doesn't bring down the system
- Independent scaling: Scale strategy engines separately from execution
- Upgrade flexibility: Update one component without downtime
- Technology diversity: Use best language for each component

### Why Three Execution Modes?

- **Observation:** Safe initial deployment, gather data without risk
- **Simulation:** Test strategies without real money
- **Live:** Production trading with real capital

Always progress through modes sequentially.

## Performance Targets Summary

| Metric | Target | Critical |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Internal Processing Latency | <1ms | <5ms |
| Market Data Ingestion | <100Î¼s | <500Î¼s |
| Strategy Decision | <500Î¼s | <2ms |
| Order Validation | <200Î¼s | <1ms |
| Throughput (market data) | 10,000/sec | 5,000/sec |
| Uptime (market hours) | 99.99% | 99.9% |

## Technology-Agnostic Patterns Used

### Communication Patterns

1. **Request-Reply:** Order submission, account queries
2. **Publish-Subscribe:** Market data distribution, fill events
3. **Streaming:** Dashboard updates, metrics
4. **Shared Memory:** Ultra-low latency (optional)

### Fault Tolerance Patterns

1. **Circuit Breaker:** Prevent cascading failures
2. **Exponential Backoff:** Automatic reconnection
3. **Health Checks:** Liveness, readiness, startup
4. **Graceful Degradation:** Operate with reduced functionality

### Data Patterns

1. **Hot-Warm-Cold:** Different storage tiers by access pattern
2. **Time-Series Optimization:** Compression, retention policies
3. **Event Sourcing:** Order lifecycle tracking
4. **CQRS:** Separate read and write models

## FAQ

### Q: Do I have to use the same technology stack as the reference implementation?

**A:** No! The documentation is technology-agnostic. Choose any languages, databases, and frameworks that meet the performance and reliability requirements.

### Q: Can I simplify the architecture for a smaller deployment?

**A:** Yes. For single-server deployment, you can:
- Use shared memory instead of message queues
- Combine services into fewer processes
- Use a single database instance

Just maintain the logical separation of concerns.

### Q: What if I only want to implement specific components?

**A:** Each component specification is self-contained. You can:
- Implement only the market data pipeline
- Implement only the strategy engine
- Build against mocked interfaces for other components

### Q: How do I handle exchange-specific differences?

**A:** The specifications focus on Binance Futures but the patterns are universal:
- Abstract exchange-specific details behind interfaces
- Implement exchange adapters for each supported exchange
- Use configuration to switch between exchanges

### Q: What's the minimum viable implementation?

**A:** For a working proof-of-concept:
1. Market Data Pipeline (basic WebSocket + order book)
2. Order Execution (validation + submission)
3. One simple strategy (e.g., momentum)
4. Basic monitoring (logs + metrics)

This can be built in 2-4 weeks depending on experience.
